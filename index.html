            <p>
                According to all known laws of aviation, a bee should not be able to fly. Likewise, a developer should not be able to
                create a website without going insane. However, I have done so. This website is a submission for ECE461L HW4, and is a simple website
                that demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS. Now, here's a picture of hastune miku because why not.

            <p>
                I have a few other projects that I am working on, but they are currently confidential since I have not found an open source equivalent of
                the systems I'm building. The main one uses LLM technology for response generation, so who knows maybe I can give skynet the ability to
                talk trash while its taking over the world.talk trash while it's taking over the world. You can find my github <a href="https://youtu.be/cqT0OKlEo9w?si=R4T6Ozf-cJjBC2g8&t=8" class="link">here</a>.
